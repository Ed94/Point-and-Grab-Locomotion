# Point-and-Grab-Locomotion
A locomotion being developed using unity3D for now.

This is a project to a create a form of locomotion involving the use of picking a direction with the HTC Vive's motion controllers,
and with the trigger activated; translate the change in position of the controller to a velocity induced on the players position to the direction choosen.
